# Config schema (`~/.config/mien/config.json`)

Default location: `~/.config/mien/config.json`. Override with `MIEN_CONFIG=/some/path`.

Top level:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema_version": 1,
  "secrets_backend": { "type": "...", /* options */ },
  "bootstrap": { /* optional, backend-specific */ },
  "secret_naming": { "default": "...", "slack_token": "..." },
  "profiles": { "<name>": { /* see Profile blocks */ } }
}
```

Those five are the complete accepted top-level set; anything else is an error (see below). `$schema_version` is what mien writes, and the unprefixed `schema_version` is accepted as an equivalent spelling — accepted, never advertised: the error listing the valid keys names only `$schema_version`, so a hand-written config is steered to one spelling. Give both and the prefixed one wins.

**Two of the five are required.** `$schema_version` — omit it and the load fails with `Unsupported schema_version None; expected 1`, because a file that does not say which schema it is written to is one mien cannot claim to understand, and this is checked *before* the unknown-key check so a config from a future schema is told its version is unsupported rather than blamed for a key that version legitimately added. And `secrets_backend`, or more precisely `secrets_backend.type` — without it mien cannot tell where secrets live. `bootstrap`, `secret_naming` and `profiles` each default to empty when absent.

`secret_naming` accepts exactly two keys, `default` and `slack_token`, each a template for a rendered backend secret name. Either may be omitted, in which case the built-in template applies (`mien-{profile}-{service}-{kind}` and `mien-{profile}-slack-{workspace}-token`).

A template you do supply must use **exactly the tokens mien renders it with, each as a bare `{name}`** — `{profile}`, `{service}` and `{kind}` for `default`; `{profile}` and `{workspace}` for `slack_token` (not `{service}`, since the literal `slack` is the template's own text). Arrangement and surrounding text are yours; the set of tokens and the shape of each is not. Two rules enforce that at load time, and they catch different mistakes.

**Every required token must appear, plainly.** Drop one and two credentials render the same backend secret name: the second `mien login` overwrites the first with nothing said, and a later `mien logout` of either deletes the secret the other still points at. Drop `{kind}` and every credential of one service collides — including every `--service custom` variable; drop `{service}` and atlassian's token collides with notion's; drop `{profile}` and two identities share one secret, which is the one thing mien exists to keep apart. A token dressed up does not count as spent: `{kind:.1s}` keeps one character of the name, `{kind:.0s}` keeps none, `{kind[0]}` the same, `{kind!r}` wraps it in quotes, a width or fill pads it with spaces, and `{{kind}}` is an escaped literal that substitutes nothing. All are refused, because every value here is already a string — no format spec on these tokens does anything useful, and several quietly reintroduce the collision.

**No other field may appear.** A positional field (`{}`, `{0}`), a token belonging to the *other* `secret_naming` template, or one hidden inside a nested format spec has nothing to stand for, so the template cannot render a name at all. Left in, it takes down **every** `mien login` — both templates are rendered on each one, so a bad `slack_token` template stops you logging in to GitHub — with a bare exception instead of a message. Checked by rendering the template once at load time, which is the only way to catch the nested and positional forms.

The two rules are independent and neither implies the other: the first is about whether two different inputs can produce one name, the second about whether any input produces a name at all. A template that is not even parseable is a `ConfigError` too, rather than a bare `ValueError`, since the fail-open surfaces recognize only `ConfigError`.

## Backends

`secrets_backend` carries a `type` plus exactly the options that backend reads — every required one present, nothing else alongside them.

| type | required options | optional options | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gcp_secret_manager` | `project` | — | GCP Secret Manager |
| `macos_keychain` | — | `service_prefix` (default `mien-`) | macOS login keychain |
| `keyring` | — | `service_prefix` (default `mien-`) | Linux Secret Service / Windows Credential Locker; free, no cloud; requires a desktop session (does NOT work headless) |

```jsonc
{ "type": "gcp_secret_manager", "project": "<gcp-project>" }
{ "type": "macos_keychain", "service_prefix": "mien-" }
{ "type": "keyring", "service_prefix": "mien-" }
```

An option this backend does not read (`"projct"`), or a required one that is missing (`project` under `gcp_secret_manager`), is a parse-time `ConfigError` naming the key — see below.

`type` itself must be a **string**, checked while parsing like every other leaf value: `{"type": ["keyring"]}` or `{"type": null}` is `secrets_backend: 'type' must be a string, got list: ['keyring']`, not a backend mien then tries to look up. A value that is not a string cannot name a backend at all, so it is a malformed config rather than an unrecognized one, and reporting it any later would put it into a dictionary and a set lookup — where an unhashable value escapes as a `TypeError` that the fail-open surfaces do not recognize as a config failure.

**An unrecognized `type` — a string that names no backend mien has — is a different check with a different message**, and not this one: it is raised not while parsing but the first time a command actually reaches for the backend — anything that reads or writes a secret, plus `sync` and `push`, which branch on whether the backend is a cloud one and must not read a retired cloud backend as "local, nothing to do". A config-only command (`mien which`, `mien list`, `mien discover`) still works with a backend type mien does not know. A type mien has *retired* (`oci_vault`) gets the migration story — re-init on a supported backend and log in again, or install a mien old enough to still export what is stored there — rather than the "did you typo an option?" answer. Options are only checked against a type mien knows, so an unknown type is reported on its own terms instead of dragging a pile of "unknown option" noise along with it.

## Unknown keys are fatal

A key mien does not recognize — at the top level, inside `secrets_backend` (an option the declared backend does not read), inside `secret_naming`, at profile level, inside any service block (`google`, `github`, a `slack` entry, `aws`, `oci`, `atlassian`, `notion`), or inside a `project_env` entry — is a hard error, not a dropped field. So is a required key that is *missing*, including a required backend option. The load raises `ConfigError`, so one typo anywhere makes the whole config unusable until it is fixed — not just the profile it sits in.

`bootstrap` is the one block held to no key list: it is backend-specific and free-form, so mien checks only that it is a JSON object. Two blocks have keys *you* name rather than keys mien enumerates — a `project_env` entry's `env` and a profile's `custom`, whose keys are environment variable names — and those are checked against a rule instead of a list: see each section below.

That blast radius is deliberate. Silently dropping the key is the quieter failure and the worse one: `"profles"` at the top level yields a config with *zero* profiles, so every identity disappears and `mien which` resolves to nothing; `"defalt"` in `secret_naming` reverts to the built-in template, so `mien login` writes secrets under a different name than the config declares and anything already stored under the intended name becomes unreachable; `"defualt_for"` discards a directory claim and the directory falls through to some other profile's catch-all glob; `"profil"` in an `aws` block leaves `AWS_PROFILE` unexported and the CLI falls back to its own default account. Nothing warns, the command succeeds, and it succeeds as the wrong person. A misconfigured identity has to fail loudly.

What "fail loudly" costs depends on what the command was about to do. The rule is stated once here, deliberately, rather than as a roster of command names: a roster goes stale the next time a command is added, and this is the rule the code implements — **every command that reads the config fails hard, except the fail-open surfaces below, which do the part they still can and announce the part they cannot.**

- **Failing hard means exit 1.** The command prints the parse error, the config's path, and what that costs you, then stops. No partial degradation: if it loads the config at all — to act as an identity, resolve one, display one, or write one back — a config it cannot understand stops it. Acting on a config mien cannot understand is exactly how the wrong identity acts.
- **The always-on display and gate surfaces fail open — exit 0 — but say so.** `mien statusline` and `mien prompt` print a compact red marker (`⚠ mien:config unreadable — run 'mien doctor'`, and `⚠mien:config` for the prompt) on **stdout**, where the identity segment would go, and exit 0: those two render their own stdout, so a message on stderr would leave the segment blank — and a status line that empties out reads as "nothing to report" when in fact mien can no longer tell who you are here. `mien guard` prints `mien: guard is NOT enforcing — config unreadable: <error>` on **stderr** and exits 0 — deliberately, so a broken config never wedges a commit, but never silently: a guard that has stopped guarding without admitting it is the worse failure. Neither surface refuses, and neither goes quiet.
- **`mien unset` and `mien status` fail open too, for a different reason.** Both read the config only for variable *names*: the set of variables mien manages is not fixed, because a profile's `custom` block names its own (below). When the config cannot be read they fall back to mien's built-in variables and put the shortfall on **stderr** — `mien: unsetting only mien's built-in variables; any custom variable a profile defines may still be set …  — config unreadable: <error>`. `unset` especially must not exit non-zero: it is eval'd through the `mien-unset` shell function (`clears="$(command mien unset)" || return $?`), so a non-zero exit means the wrapper evals nothing and *nothing at all* is cleared, losing the built-in scrub as well in a shell whose whole purpose was to stop carrying an identity. The message goes to stderr for the same reason — the wrapper captures stdout and evals it.
- **A few commands read no config at all, so a broken one cannot touch them:** `init`, `shell-init`, `preflight`. `init` is the one that matters when you are stuck: it checks only whether the file *exists* and never parses it, so it is the way out of a config too broken to hand-edit. It writes a fresh one over the top — it replaces your profiles, it does not repair them.

The message names the offending key and lists the valid ones for that block, so the fix is mechanical. **When hand-editing, add only keys enumerated here — the five top-level keys above, `type` plus that backend's own options from the table above, `default` / `slack_token` inside `secret_naming`, and the profile and service keys below.**

Keys from older mien versions are tolerated by name, and only at the value that made their removal a no-op — an old config still loads:

| key | where | tolerated value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `git_name` | profile | any (no code path ever read it) |
| `gcloud_login_required` | `google` | `false` |
| `team_id` | `slack` entry | `null` |

Any *other* value for `gcloud_login_required` / `team_id` is an error rather than a silent drop: it meant something once, so discarding it would change behaviour without saying so. The error carries that key's own remedy, because for a key whose capability was removed the obvious fix — delete it — *is* a behaviour change.

`team_id` is the one retired key mien still *writes*. Every serialized `slack` entry carries `"team_id": null`, including the copy `mien push` stores as the shared backend manifest, as a write-side compatibility shim: an older mien reading that manifest still requires the key and fails without it. It remains retired on the way in — loading drops it — so it is a field of the file, not of the config. Expect it in a config mien wrote; do not add it by hand, and do not read anything into it.

## Profile blocks

Every profile-level key is optional; a service the profile omits (or sets to `null`) simply does not exist for it. Present-but-empty is not the same thing: `"google": {}` is a truncated block, not an absent one, and goes through every check — so `aws` and `oci`, whose fields are all optional, parse as empty blocks, while `google` reports the seven keys it is missing. This is the complete accepted set:

| key | type | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `google` | object \| null | Google account (Gmail/Calendar/Drive + GCP) |
| `github` | object \| null | GitHub account |
| `slack` | array of objects | zero or more workspaces |
| `aws` | object \| null | AWS credentials or named profile |
| `oci` | object \| null | OCI CLI profile |
| `atlassian` | object \| null | Jira/Confluence account |
| `notion` | object \| null | Notion integration token |
| `custom` | object | your own credentials, as `"<VAR_NAME>": "<backend-ref>"` |
| `project_env` | array of objects | ambient env by directory |
| `default_for` | array of strings | directory globs claiming identity |
| `owns_remotes` | array of strings | git-remote globs claiming identity |
| `git_email` | string \| null | git author address for the cross-check |

**Shapes are checked, not coerced.** A service block must be a JSON object, `slack` and `project_env` must be arrays of JSON objects, and `default_for` / `owns_remotes` must be arrays of strings. A wrong type is reported as a `ConfigError` naming the block — never coerced, and never allowed to escape as a `TypeError`, because every fail-open surface listed above recognizes only `ConfigError` as "I have stopped working" and would otherwise exit in silence.

**Values are checked too, at the leaves.** The type each field is declared with is enforced, not merely documented: `"username": 42` is `profile 'work': github: 'username' must be a string, got int: 42`, at parse time, rather than a value carried until something first uses it as text and dies there as an `AttributeError` the fail-open surfaces do not recognize. Nullability is part of that type — a field written below as `"..."|null` accepts `null`, and one written without it does not. So `"secret_naming": {"default": null}` is an error: a null there is not "fall back to the built-in template", it is a template that cannot be rendered. Booleans are not integers for this purpose; `true` is accepted only where the field really is a boolean.

Within a block, a **missing required field** is the same class of error as an unknown one, reported with the block's valid key list.

**Required-to-be-present and may-hold-`null` are different rules**, and a hand-edit needs both. A field is required because it declares no default, and it accepts `null` because its type says so — so a required key can legitimately carry `null` (every `"...|null"` key in the `google` block below is required *and* nullable), and dropping the key is an error even where `null` is fine. Conversely, a key you may omit entirely still has to hold a value of its declared type when you do write it.

### `google`
```jsonc
{
  "email": "...",
  "oauth_client_id": "...",
  "oauth_client_secret_ref": "<backend-ref>|null",
  "refresh_token_ref":       "<backend-ref>|null",
  "adc_ref":                 "<backend-ref>|null",
  "gcloud_config_name":      "<typically equals profile name>",
  "default_project":         "..."|null
}
```

All seven keys are required to be *present* when the block is present. Four of them may also hold `null`: `oauth_client_secret_ref`, `refresh_token_ref`, `adc_ref` and `default_project`. The other three — `email`, `oauth_client_id`, `gcloud_config_name` — must be strings.

`null` here is a working state, not an unset field. A gcloud-login-only profile has no stored refresh token and no stored OAuth client secret; every reader guards on that (`mien env`, `mien whoami`, `mien logout`), mien's own configs carry `null` there, and it is exactly the shape the `gcloud_login_required` retirement remedy above tells you to write. Omitting the key is still an error — presence and nullability are separate rules, and `null` is how you say "this profile has no such secret".

### `github`
```jsonc
{
  "username": "...",
  "host": "github.com",
  "token_ref":     "<backend-ref>|null",   // optional
  "ssh_key_path":  "<path>|null",          // optional
  "ssh_key_ref":   "<backend-ref>|null"    // optional
}
```

`username` and `host` are required. `ssh_key_ref` (key contents in the backend, materialized per-shell) takes precedence over `ssh_key_path` (a static on-device key file).

### `slack` (array)
```jsonc
[{ "workspace": "team-a", "user_token_ref": "<backend-ref>" }]
```

Both keys are required in each entry.

### `aws`
```jsonc
{
  "region":                  "..."|null,
  "profile":                 "..."|null,
  "access_key_id_ref":       "<backend-ref>|null",
  "secret_access_key_ref":   "<backend-ref>|null"
}
```

All four are optional — the block may carry a named `~/.aws/config` profile, static keys from the backend, or both.

### `oci`
```jsonc
{ "profile": "..."|null, "config_file": "<path>|null" }
```

Both optional.

### `atlassian`
```jsonc
{ "email": "...", "base_url": "https://<site>.atlassian.net", "api_token_ref": "<backend-ref>" }
```

All three are required. Atlassian Cloud is HTTP Basic (`email:token`), so the email is part of the credential, not decoration.

### `notion`
```jsonc
{ "api_token_ref": "<backend-ref>" }
```

Required when the block is present.

### `custom`

Your own credentials — an LLM API key, an npm or PyPI token, a database URL — delivered as environment variables alongside the built-in services. Each **key is the environment variable name**; each **value is a backend reference, never the secret**:

```jsonc
"custom": {
  "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "<backend-ref>",
  "NPM_TOKEN":         "<backend-ref>"
}
```

That the value is a reference is the whole point, and it is exactly where `project_env` differs: a `project_env` value is stored verbatim in `config.json` and uploaded verbatim in the backend manifest, so a secret typed there is a secret in two places. A `custom` value points at the backend, so `config.json` and the manifest carry the variable's *name* and a reference, and the secret itself only ever lives in the backend.

Optional, and absent means empty: a profile with no `custom` key, or with `"custom": null` or `"custom": {}`, simply has no custom variables — which is why a config written before this field existed loads unchanged.

**Write it with `mien login`, not by hand**, since the value has to exist in the backend before the reference means anything:

```bash
mien login  <profile> --service custom --name ANTHROPIC_API_KEY     # hidden prompt
mien login  <profile> --service custom --name NPM_TOKEN --secret-cmd 'op read op://Private/npm/token'
mien login  <profile> --service custom --name ANTHROPIC_API_KEY --token-stdin < keyfile
mien logout <profile> --service custom --name ANTHROPIC_API_KEY     # deletes the secret, forgets the name
```

`--name` is required with `--service custom` and refused with every other service (silently ignoring it is how someone believes they stored an API key and actually overwrote a github token). `logout` on a name the profile does not have is an error, not a no-op. The secret is read by the same three mechanisms every other service uses — hidden `getpass`, `--token-stdin`, `--secret-cmd` — and there is no fourth.

The backend secret name is rendered from the `secret_naming.default` template with `service` = `custom` and `kind` = the variable name **verbatim**, so `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` on profile `work` under the built-in template is `mien-work-custom-ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Case is preserved because environment variable names are case-sensitive: `TOKEN` and `token` are two different variables carrying two different secrets, and folding the case would render one secret name for both — the second `login` overwriting the first's secret while the config kept both names pointing at the survivor. Every supported backend takes the name as written (GCP secret IDs allow `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`; Keychain and keyring match their service/account attributes case-sensitively).

A reference whose secret is no longer in the backend — deleted there by hand, say — is reported as an error rather than a traceback, with `mien login` as the way to make the reference live again. On the surfaces that activate an identity (`mien use`, `mien exec`, `mien run`) it names the profile and the variable as well as the reference, because building the environment is the only place that knows which of the two it was reading for. Elsewhere the message carries the reference alone.

`mien logout --service custom --name <VAR>` is one of those elsewheres, and it is worth knowing before you need it: it deletes from the backend *before* it saves the config, so if the secret is already gone the delete fails, the message names only the reference, and the entry stays in your config. Restore the secret with `mien login` and then `logout`, or remove the key from `custom` by hand. This is how every service behaves, not something specific to `custom`.

**A variable name is refused four ways**, at `mien login` time *and* at parse time, so a hand-edited config fails exactly as the CLI would have:

- **It must be a shell identifier** — `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`, ASCII only, the same rule as a `project_env` `env` key and for a sharper reason: `mien use` writes a script that gets *sourced*, and a name the shell will not take breaks the loader at that line and abandons the rest of the file, so every variable the profile exports after it silently never happens.
- **It must not be a variable mien already uses for a built-in service.** Which of the two a shell ends up carrying must not be settled by the order of statements inside mien, so the collision is refused and the error names the service it would fight (`'GH_TOKEN' is the environment variable mien already uses for github`). The nineteen taken names are `MIEN_PROFILE` and `MIEN_EPHEMERAL_DIR` (mien itself); `CLOUDSDK_ACTIVE_CONFIG_NAME`, `CLOUDSDK_CORE_PROJECT`, `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` (google); `GH_TOKEN`, `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` (github); `MIEN_SLACK_TOKENS`, `MIEN_SLACK_DEFAULT_TOKEN` (slack); `AWS_PROFILE`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (aws); `OCI_CLI_PROFILE`, `OCI_CLI_CONFIG_FILE` (oci); `ATLASSIAN_EMAIL`, `ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN`, `ATLASSIAN_BASE_URL` (atlassian); `NOTION_TOKEN` (notion).
- **It must not be a variable the shell — or mien itself — reads as an instruction.** `mien use` unsets every variable mien manages and re-exports the active profile's, and that scrub list is the union over ALL profiles, so one such name in one profile makes every `mien use` and every `mien-unset` strip it in every shell, whichever profile is active. Six names are refused for that reason: `PATH` (how the shell and mien's own loader find every program), `HOME` (where every tool looks for files, mien's config included), `IFS` (how the shell splits every word it parses), `PS1` (the prompt the shell prints on every line, so the credential would be printed with it), `TMPDIR` (where mien writes the ephemeral files carrying your credentials) and `MIEN_CONFIG` (where mien reads and writes the config). The match is exact: `MY_PATH` and `PATH_TO_KEY` are ordinary names and are accepted.
- **It must not be an agent-harness capture marker** — `CLAUDECODE`, `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT` or `MIEN_CAPTURED`, the same three names `mien token` and `mien exec` check to decide whether an agent is driving. Same blast radius as the previous rule, opposite polarity: `unset CLAUDECODE` breaks no shell, and a credential exported over it still reads as "detected" — the harm is that mien reads the marker's *absence* as "no agent is watching", so the union-scrub's `unset` turns off the refusal that keeps `mien token` from printing a secret into a recorded transcript and the (deliberately un-`--force`-able) refusal that stops `mien exec` running under the wrong identity. Nothing looks broken afterwards, which is why it is refused rather than warned about. The match is exact here too: `MY_CLAUDECODE` is an ordinary name.

A value must be a **string** — `"custom": {"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": 5}` is `profile 'work': custom: 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY' must be a backend secret reference string (not the secret itself), got int: 5` — and the block itself must be a JSON object, checked like every other block rather than coerced.

**How it reaches a program.** `mien exec`, `mien run` and `mien use` export each variable with the secret as its value, so there is no path-carrying variable to dereference (`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` and `MIEN_SLACK_TOKENS` are the built-ins that work that way — `custom` deliberately does not) and no per-profile credential file of its own to clean up. `mien use` still routes every export, custom ones included, through the single 0600 loader script it writes under `$TMPDIR/mien` and deletes as it is sourced. `mien status` shows each custom variable that is set as `<set>` and never its value; `mien list` and `mien whoami` (including `--json`) show the names only. There is deliberately **no `mien token custom`**: `token` prints a raw secret on stdout, which is the surface that leaks into agent transcripts, and `mien exec <profile> -- <cmd>` covers the need.

**The scrub.** `mien use` writes a loader that `unset`s every variable mien manages before exporting the new profile's, and `mien unset` prints the same list. That list is the nineteen built-ins **plus every `custom` name defined by every profile in the config** — every profile, not just the one being activated, because what needs clearing is whatever the shell was carrying *before*. Without that, switching from a profile that defines `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to one that does not would leave the first profile's key live in the new profile's shell. `mien exec`/`mien run` still do not scrub — they layer the profile over the ambient environment, as they always have, so a custom variable inherited from elsewhere survives a profile that does not define it.

### `git_email`

The git author address a commit under this identity carries. Hand-edited, like `default_for` / `owns_remotes`.

```jsonc
"git_email": "me@acme.example"
```

Setting git's own `user.email` is git's job (native `includeIf`); mien reads `git_email` only for the author cross-check, so `mien guard` and the status line can warn when a commit's `user.email` disagrees with the identity acting here. Set it when you commit under an address none of the profile's accounts carry.

### `default_for` (array)

Directory globs this profile claims as its default identity. Resolved by `mien
which` and `mien run`.

```jsonc
["*/Projects/acme*", "*/work/*"]
```

A scope covers the directory itself and everything under it; a sibling sharing a
prefix is not covered (`*/Projects/acme` does not capture `acme-fork`). The
longest matching scope wins, and equally specific scopes on different profiles
are an error rather than a coin flip. An active `MIEN_PROFILE` overrides the
directory, with a warning on stderr when the two disagree; if it names a profile
the config does not have, the command fails instead of resolving to nothing.

`~` and `$VAR` are expanded before matching, so `~/Projects/acme` and
`$HOME/Projects/acme` are equivalent to the literal path. A variable that is
**unset or set to the empty string** is left literal and therefore matches
nothing, as is `~` when `HOME` is empty. This differs deliberately from the
`project_env` shell, where zsh expands both to the empty string — there
`$UNSET/Projects/acme` becomes `/Projects/acme`, which is *disjoint* from the
intended tree (it silently covers an unrelated path and stops covering the one
you meant), and a scope that is nothing but a reference — `$UNSET`, or
`$UNSET/*`, which normalizes to the same base — collapses to the pattern `/*`
and covers every absolute path. For identity, failing closed beats either
outcome.

Must be a list of strings. A bare string is rejected rather than coerced: JSON
has no way to tell a one-element list from a scalar, and silently accepting
`"default_for": "*/Projects/acme"` would iterate it character by character, one
of which is `*`.

Distinct from `project_env`, which maps directories to environment *values*;
`default_for` maps directories to *which identity you are*.

### `owns_remotes` (array)

Git-remote globs this profile owns. Where `default_for` claims identity by
directory, `owns_remotes` claims it by the repository's `origin` remote — by
*what the repo is* rather than where it sits — so it fits repositories kept side
by side with no per-employer directory convention.

```jsonc
["github.com/acme-*/*", "github.com/me/*"]
```

The remote is normalized before matching: the scheme, any `user@`, and a trailing
`.git` are stripped and an ssh `:` becomes `/`, so every form of the same URL
(`https://…`, `git@github.com:…`, `ssh://…`) reduces to one canonical
`host/path`, lower-cased. A pattern matches that form and everything under it, so
a bare owner (`github.com/acme`) claims the owner and its repositories. The
longest match wins; an exact tie is an error, as with `default_for`. A profile may
list several — a personal account and the organizations it also manages. Same
list-of-strings rule: a bare string is rejected, not coerced.

**It never selects an acting identity.** `owns_remotes` feeds the display surfaces (`mien statusline`, `mien prompt`) — which show whose repository this is and warn when the active `MIEN_PROFILE` disagrees — and `mien guard`, which *refuses* on that same disagreement. Blocking on the repository's own signal is safe: a crafted `origin` can at worst cause a false refusal you can override, never a mis-action. It is deliberately *not* consulted by `mien which` / `run` / `exec`, which choose an identity that *acts*: a checked-out repository controls its own `origin`, and letting a repository select an acting identity would violate the rule that a clone cannot influence which identity acts. A directory scope is part of your own config and may select an acting identity; a repository's self-declared remote may not.

### `project_env` (array)

Non-secret environment values applied ambiently by directory. `mien env sync`
renders every profile's scopes into `~/.config/mien/ambient.zsh` as
`case "$PWD/" in <base>/*)` blocks and wires `~/.zshenv` to source it.

```jsonc
[{ "match": "*/work/acme", "env": { "AWS_PROFILE": "work" } }]
```

Each entry must be a JSON object carrying a `match` glob; `env` is optional and must itself be a JSON object whose **keys are shell identifiers** — letters, digits and underscores, never starting with a digit (`[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`, ASCII only, which is what zsh's `export` accepts, not what Python's `isidentifier()` does) — and whose **values are strings**. Both halves are checked because each pair is written into `ambient.zsh` verbatim as `export <key>=<value>`: a non-string value (`{"PORT": 8080}` is a plausible hand-edit) dies in the renderer as a bare `AttributeError` nothing catches, so `mien env sync` aborts with a Python traceback on stderr instead of an actionable `Error:` line, and nothing is written; and a key that is not an identifier survives every gate downstream — `zsh -n` *parses* `export 2FA="x"`, so the file is written, and sourcing it then fails at that line and **abandons the rest of the file**, silently dropping every later export, including every other profile's scopes. `export MY VAR="x"` is quieter still: valid syntax that exports `MY` empty and never sets the variable you wrote. `match` and `env` are the only accepted keys — an entry with no `match`, or one carrying any other key, is a `ConfigError`. `match` must be a non-empty string: a non-string one would reach the renderer as an `AttributeError` nothing catches, and an *empty* one normalizes to a base of `""`, so the emitted `case "$PWD/" in /*)` fires in every directory and exports that scope's env everywhere — the same silent widening the list-of-strings rule exists to stop. The unknown-key rule matters most here: a typo'd `env` would otherwise leave the scope exporting nothing, so the directory silently falls back to whatever account the underlying CLI defaults to.

`match` follows the same directory-glob rules as `default_for` (the directory
itself and everything under it; a trailing `/*` or `/` is normalized away).
Values are non-secret only — no secrets-backend refs.

**Variable references in `match` are evaluated in `~/.zshenv`, which zsh reads
before `~/.zshrc` and `~/.zprofile`.** Anything the user exports from their own
dotfiles is therefore unset at match time and expands to nothing, with the
consequences described under `default_for` above: `$WORK_ROOT/*` becomes `/*`
and applies that scope's env — `AWS_PROFILE` included — in every directory. Only
parameters that already exist that early (`$HOME`, `$USER` and the like, set by
zsh itself or inherited from the login process) are safe; `~` is safe too, since
tilde expansion consults the password database. `$TMPDIR` is deliberately *not*
treated as safe — macOS launchd sets it, but stock sshd and a default Linux PAM
do not, and mien pins no platform. `mien env sync` prints a warning naming the
profile and scope for any other reference, and still writes the file — an
existing working config is not broken by the check.

## Reserved backend secret name

`mien-config-manifest` is reserved: `mien` stores a non-secret snapshot of
`config.json` (refs and identifiers only — no secret values) under this name in
the cloud backend (`gcp_secret_manager`). It is pushed automatically
after every `mien login` / `mien logout`. Do not create a profile whose rendered
secret name collides with it.
