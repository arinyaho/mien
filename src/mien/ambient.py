# Parameters already holding a NON-EMPTY value when `~/.zshenv` is read, so a
# scope referring to one expands as written.
#
# A reference is expandable only if zsh sets the parameter before reading any
# startup file, or EVERY process that can start such a zsh puts it in the
# inherited environment — login(1), launchd, sshd, PAM. "Some starter supplies
# it" is not enough: `~/.zshenv` is read by every zsh including scripts, `zsh
# -c`, launchd jobs and cron, and a parameter missing from any of those
# collapses the scope there. So a terminal application does not count, nor does
# a parent interactive shell — a child zsh inherits what its parent exported,
# but the top-level shell reading `~/.zshenv` does not, and it is the one the
# generated script must be correct for. Exports from `~/.zshrc` and
# `~/.zprofile` do not count either: zsh reads `~/.zshenv` FIRST.
#
# A wrong entry is a false negative in the dangerous direction: it suppresses
# the warning while the scope silently widens and can select credentials
# everywhere. A missing entry costs one extra warning. So every entry must be
# verifiable by probing zsh, and anything doubtful stays off. A ubiquitous
# parameter like `HOME` belongs ON the list: being listed suppresses the
# warning, and warning about it would teach users to ignore the ones that fire
# for real. Set but empty counts as unset, an empty expansion collapsing the
# scope exactly like a missing parameter.
#
# Absent, each for its own reason: TTY (zsh sets it empty whenever stdin is not a
# terminal, which is most shells reading `~/.zshenv`); ZDOTDIR (zsh never sets
# it, and if the user did, zsh reads `$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv` rather than the
# `~/.zshenv` `ensure_zshenv_sources` wires up, so this code is not running);
# HOSTNAME (zsh sets HOST, and no login path exports HOSTNAME). `~`
# needs no entry — tilde expansion consults the password database, surviving
# even an unset HOME.

    # launchd-started zsh inherits USER/SHELL/HOME/LOGNAME/PATH and neither, and
    # stock sshd forwards neither, so such a scope collapses to `/*` in exactly
    # the non-interactive shells `~/.zshenv` is read by — as with TTY.
    #
    # TMPDIR is subtler: launchd sets it per-user on macOS, but stock sshd and a
    # default Linux PAM do not, and mien pins no platform. Resting the guarantee
    # on one OS is the silent false negative this set exists to avoid, so TMPDIR
    # is off the list and `env sync` warns about it instead.
