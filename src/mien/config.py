      overwrite the profile's real ``GH_TOKEN`` -- and would do the opposite if
      the order were ever reversed. Which of the two credentials a shell ends up
      carrying must not be settled by statement order, so it is refused and the
      message names the service it would fight.
    - **Shell-critical.** The loader ``unset``s every managed variable and
      re-``export``s the active profile's, and the scrub list is the union over
      every profile (``mien.shell.scrub_vars``). A name the shell or mien itself

      ``mien use`` and every ``mien-unset`` strip it, everywhere. The exact-match

      template, which changes *where secrets live* -- `mien login` writes under
      the built-in name while the operator believes the config's name is in
      force, and secrets already stored under the intended name become
      unreachable.
    - profile: `defualt_for` simply drops the directory claim, and the directory
      then falls to some other profile's catch-all glob.
    - `project_env` entry: `{"match": "*/work", "envs": {...}}` builds a scope

      `AWS_PROFILE`, the tool falls back to its own default account, and the
