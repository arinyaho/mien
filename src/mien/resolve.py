    The one shape `_authority`'s own docstring already says has no syntactic
    resolution: a successful parse whose path starts with a segment
    containing `@` — indistinguishable from a truncated userinfo (a password
    with an unencoded `/` and no `:`) *and* from an ordinary, untruncated
    remote whose path legitimately starts with an `@` segment. Several
    attempts to guess which one it is — testing a recovered candidate
    against the configured owners, gating on dots, gating on scan depth —
    each turned out to have a symmetric counter-example: strict enough to
    avoid misattributing a real, untruncated remote to the wrong configured
    owner, and it also misses genuine truncation; loose enough to catch
    genuine truncation, and it also misattributes an untruncated remote
    (`https://github.com/foo@bar.com/baz` — a real, complete host — to
    whoever owns `bar.com/baz`). That is not a narrower, separately fixable
    gap; it is the same ambiguity in both directions at once.

    So this detects the shape without ever guessing an owner from it: a
    caller that only ever *displays* a claim (the status line, `mien
    discover`) can keep matching only what it can already confidently
    normalize, silently missing this shape exactly as before. A caller that
    must never silently misattribute one (`mien exec`'s origin-owner veto,
    via `handover.refusal_reason`) can refuse instead of guessing — which is
    what "wrong identity is the failure mode that matters" requires here:
    an unresolvable authority is not evidence of nothing, it is evidence of
    not knowing, and guessing either way risks the failure this exists to
    prevent.

    Checks the whole path for a leftover `@`, not only its first segment: a
    truncated userinfo can itself contain more than one unencoded `/` before
    its own `@` (`https://work/sekrit/more@github.com/...`), which would
    otherwise leave this returning False for a shape every bit as
    unparseable as the single-slash case. Scanning only the first segment
    was the right trade-off for the old guessing design — a missed
    detection there just meant "no match", the same safe direction as an
    ordinary unowned remote. It is the wrong trade-off here: a missed
    detection now means `refusal_reason` silently *allows* the handover for
    a genuinely unparseable origin, the opposite of what this function
    exists to prevent. There is no corresponding downside to scanning
    further: unlike the old recovery guess, this never names an owner, so a
    broader match only ever costs a spurious refusal, never a
    misattribution — the same accepted direction as every other case here.

    Also true whenever `_authority` itself returns `None` — an unencoded `/`
    *with* a `:` in the password, an NFKC-unstable netloc, a stray `]`. This
    is the shape `_authority`'s docstring calls the more clearly unparseable
    of the two: `normalize_remote`'s own fallback for it is a blind
    "strip to the last `@`" guess, safe only for *display*, exactly like the
    successful-but-ambiguous parse above. Without this, `claimed_profile`
    could hand `refusal_reason` a confident-looking claim built on that same
    blind guess, and a request matching the guess would slip through before
    the ambiguity check is ever reached — the exact "a guess wins" failure
    this refusal exists to prevent, just reached through the other branch of
    `_authority` instead.
