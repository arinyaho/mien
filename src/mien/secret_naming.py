# worse than no message.

# The tokens each template is rendered with, and therefore the ones it MUST
# spend, one secret name per credential. Read off the `render_name` call sites in
# `mien login`; every one of the three is load-bearing:
#
# - `kind` separates two credentials of ONE service on one profile: github's
#   `token` from its `ssh_key`, google's `oauth_client_secret` from its
#   `refresh`, aws's `access_key_id` from its `secret_access_key` -- and, for
#   `--service custom`, one variable name from the next, which is the whole of
#   what keeps `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `NPM_TOKEN` apart.
# - `service` separates two services on one profile: atlassian's `api_token`
#   from notion's, which are the same `kind` under different services.
# - `profile` separates the identities, which is mien's entire purpose: without
#   it `work` and `personal` share one github token secret.
# - `workspace` (slack only) separates two Slack workspaces on one profile.
#
# `slack_token` gets no `service` token because the literal "slack" is the
# template's own job; it is not something mien substitutes.
#
# This is also, EXACTLY, the set of tokens each template is SUPPLIED with -- every
# `render_name(secret_naming.default, ...)` call site passes `profile`, `service`
# and `kind` and nothing else, and every `render_name(secret_naming.slack_token,
# ...)` passes `profile` and `workspace` and nothing else. So the two directions
# of the check in `mien.config._check_secret_name_template` read the same table:
# a required token the template does not spend collapses two credentials onto one
# secret, and a field the template asks for that is not in this set has no value
# to substitute and cannot render at all. If a new call site ever supplies a
# further token, it belongs here, or every existing config becomes unrenderable.

      so two kinds sharing a first character still render one name; the field
      name is not ``kind`` either way.
    - ``{kind:.1s}`` truncates it to one character, and ``{kind:.0s}`` renders
      nothing at all -- byte-identical to dropping ``{kind}``. Every value here is
      already a ``str``, so a format spec can only pad it, truncate it, or do
      nothing; none of those is a use, and truncation is an active collision.
    - ``{kind!r}`` wraps it in quotes: renderable, but a quoted secret name is
      never what someone meant.

    different function of the token, and the collision check has no business
    treating it as the token. See ``mien.config._check_secret_name_template``.
