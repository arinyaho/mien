# Variables a `custom` credential may not be named after, each mapped to what it
# is — the message quotes the phrase, so a name cannot be listed here without
# saying why (`mien.config.check_custom_var_name`).
#
# One rule, in two halves, and an entry has to satisfy at least one: the
# machinery that carries out `mien use` / `mien unset` READS this variable as an
# instruction rather than carrying it as payload, so either (a) `unset`ting it
# stops the shell or the loader from working, or (b) `export`ing a credential
# over it puts that credential somewhere nobody asked for. The blast radius is
# what makes the refusal worth having: `scrub_vars` is the union over EVERY
# profile, so one such name in one profile makes every `mien use` and every
# `mien-unset`, in every shell, strip it.
#
# Deliberately NOT a denylist of POSIX variables. A long list is unmaintainable
# and would refuse names that are only ever payload; candidates weighed and left
# off, each for a reason that can be checked:
#
# - `PWD`/`OLDPWD`: zsh and bash re-set `PWD` on the next `cd`, so the `unset` is
#   self-healing, and mien already distrusts the value it finds (`_trusted_cwd`
#   validates it with `samefile` and falls back to `os.getcwd()`).
# - `MIEN_GUARD`/`MIEN_EXEC`/`MIEN_TOKEN`: opt-OUTs, matched against a fixed set
#   of off-values. Unset or overwritten with a credential, both land on "guard
#   on" — the safe side — so neither half of the rule is met. Note the contrast
#   with `CAPTURE_MARKER_VARS` below, which are also `MIEN_*`-adjacent signals and
#   ARE refused: what separates them is polarity, not naming. These three are
#   read as "is the value one of a fixed set of off-words?", so absence means
#   enforcing; a capture marker is read as "is anything set?", so absence means
#   permissive — which is why the scrub's `unset` is harmless here and unsafe
#   there.
# - `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`: mien reads it for one non-credential path (the global
#   gitignore `.mien` goes in), and that write already fails soft on `OSError`.
# - `LD_PRELOAD`/`DYLD_*`: neither half holds. `unset` does not break the shell,
#   and exporting a credential leaves the dynamic loader failing to open a
#   library by that name — it stores no credential anywhere. The remaining
#   argument, that mien should not be a channel for library injection, is a
#   security claim this check cannot back: the value comes from the user's own
#   backend into the user's own shell, granting nothing they could not do with
#   `export` themselves, and listing them would advertise a sandbox mien does
#   not implement.
SHELL_CRITICAL_VARS: dict[str, str] = {
    # (a) The shell finds every program through it — and so does mien's own
    # loader: the `mien-use` wrapper runs `command mien`, and the script it evals
    # runs `rm -f`. Unset, nothing in the shell runs at all.
    "PATH": "how the shell — and mien's own loader — finds every program it runs",
    # (a) Tilde expansion, and every tool's idea of where its config lives,
    # including mien's: `config_path` reads `$HOME/.config/mien/config.json`, so
    # a credential exported over it hides mien's config from mien.
    "HOME": "where the shell, mien and every other tool look for files, mien's own config included",
    # (a) The shell splits every unquoted expansion by it, including inside the
    # `eval` that loads a profile, so a credential here changes how the shell
    # parses everything that comes after.
    "IFS": "how the shell splits every word it parses",
    # (b) The shell renders it at every prompt, so exporting a credential over it
    # PRINTS that credential to the terminal on every line — the exact leak
    # `emit_use` exists to prevent — and it is exported, so child shells too.
    "PS1": "the prompt the shell renders, and prints, on every line",
    # (b) mien resolves its ephemeral store from it (`_env_script_dir`,
    # `EphemeralStore`). Exported over with a credential, the value is not a
    # directory: mien creates one NAMED for the credential under whatever the
    # current directory happens to be — a git worktree, say — and drops the
    # plaintext files there, where `mien doctor --gc` run from anywhere else will
    # never sweep them.
    "TMPDIR": "where mien writes the ephemeral files that carry your credentials",
    # (b) `config_path` honours it, so a credential exported over it points every
    # later mien command at a config that does not exist — `mien status` reports
    # nothing, and `mien login` writes a fresh config to a path named for the
    # credential. The `unset` half misdirects too: a shell deliberately pointed
    # at another config silently falls back to the default one.
    "MIEN_CONFIG": "where mien reads and writes the config that holds every profile",

# Environment markers that say an agent harness is recording this command's
# output. Presence means: anything mien writes to stdout may be captured into a
# transcript that outlives the command — so printing a raw secret there is not a
# transient exposure but a durable one. `mien token` refuses on it, and
# `mien exec` refuses a wrong identity on it. The set is a heuristic and
# deliberately fails *open*: an unrecognized harness is not detected, so this is
# a backstop for the common case, never a guarantee.
#
# This is the ONE list of marker names: `mien.cli.capture_context` reads it to
# detect a harness and `mien.config.check_custom_var_name` reads it to refuse the
# same names as `custom` credentials. A second copy would let the detection and
# the refusal drift, and a marker mien detects but does not refuse is a marker
# the scrub can `unset`.
#
# Refused as a `custom` name for a reason NEXT TO the `SHELL_CRITICAL_VARS` rule
# rather than inside it, which is why the names live in their own map with their
# own message: neither half of that rule holds here. `unset CLAUDECODE` breaks no
# shell and no loader (a), and a credential exported over it leaves the value
# non-empty — still "detected", the safe side (b). What disqualifies these is a
# third property: mien reads the variable as a safety SIGNAL whose ABSENCE is the
# permissive state, so the scrub's `unset` is what moves it to the unsafe side.
# The blast radius is the same as the other rule's — `scrub_vars` is the union
# over EVERY profile, so one such name in one profile makes every `mien use` and
# every `mien-unset`, in every shell, emit `unset CLAUDECODE` — but the damage is
# quieter: a broken `PATH` is self-evident, while a disarmed refusal shows up only
# as a secret that gets printed when you expected it to be withheld.
#
# Each name maps to what it is, because the refusal quotes the phrase: a marker
# cannot be added here (or to the detection, which is the same thing) without
# saying what sets it.
