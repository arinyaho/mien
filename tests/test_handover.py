"""`mien exec` refuses to hand credentials to an agent standing somewhere else.

Two layers are exercised here: the pure decision (`mien.handover.refusal_reason`)

are pinned, because a CliRunner cannot easily produce "the config object itself
misbehaves"; the command layer pins that the decision is actually wired in front
